Ideas for bot algorithms:

PROTECT THE ARCHER!
 Goal:
Create a formation of soliders which protect the an archer.
Key: x = archer a = solider

a a
axa
 a

Archer cannot be got to without killing off at least one of the soliders first.
Archer can shoot enemies without fear of death.

Goal of formation:
Reach the enemies base with minimum loses, and not losing the main archer, then destroy the base.

Loop:
Workers will constantly run between resources and the collection point. 
Soliders will be spawned and walked to a position near their spawn.
They will wait until enough soliders have been spawned to form the protective formation.
An Archer will be spawned and will move into position in the formation.
This formation will then advance to the enemies base, until enough untis die to break formation or until they reach and destroy the base.
MEANWHILE the spawner and worker will keep working to make more of these formations.

Pros:
Very aggresive in a safe nature. Should maintain minmal loses while being very aggressive.
Will make for quick games and avoid time outs / draws.


Cons:
Leaves very little defenses for our base.

Things which may help: adding additional defensive algoritms.
